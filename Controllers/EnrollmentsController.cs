/* How to Explain This in Your Viva
"This controller manages enrollments using a service layer, which ensures a clean separation of concerns."
"We use HTTP status codes effectively to provide clear responses to clients."
"Pagination helps optimize performance by fetching only a limited set of results at a time."
"Deleting an enrollment returns 204 No Content, which is the best practice for delete operations." */
